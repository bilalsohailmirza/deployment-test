## II. Design Instructions

This section provides guidance for the visual design of the landing page, ensuring it aligns with the brand identity and effectively communicates the value proposition.

**A. Overall Style:**

* **Modern and Minimal:**  Emphasize clean lines, ample white space, and a clutter-free layout. Avoid overly decorative elements.
* **Business-Oriented:** Maintain a professional and trustworthy aesthetic.
* **Gold Accents:**  Use gold sparingly but strategically to highlight key elements like headings, icons, interactive elements, and possibly subtle lines or borders. The gold should be a sophisticated shade, not overly bright or gaudy. Consider using it for hover states or active elements for subtle interactivity.
* **Black and White Dominance:** The primary color scheme should be black and white, providing a strong contrast and a sense of elegance. Use varying shades of gray for depth and visual interest.

**B. Color Palette:**

* **Primary:** White (#FFFFFF)
* **Secondary:** Black (#000000)
* **Accent:** Gold (a sophisticated shade - suggest researching "elegant gold color codes")
* **Text:** Primarily black on white, consider white text on dark backgrounds where appropriate.

**C. Typography:**

* **Headings:**  A clean, modern, and slightly bolder sans-serif font (e.g., Montserrat, Open Sans, Lato). Use gold sparingly for emphasis on specific words or titles.
* **Body Copy:** A legible and comfortable sans-serif font for readability (same as headings or a similar pairing). Use black or dark gray for optimal contrast.

**D. Imagery & Graphics:**

* **High-Quality and Professional:**  Use professional stock photos or illustrations that are relevant to the content and industry. Avoid generic or low-resolution images.
* **Animation:**
    * **Subtle and Fluid:** The hero section animation should be captivating but not distracting. Consider abstract representations of data flow, connecting nodes, or subtle light effects.
    * **Business-Oriented:** The animation should feel sophisticated and relevant to the business context.
    * **Performance:** Ensure the animation is optimized for performance and doesn't impact page load times. Consider using lightweight vector animations (e.g., Lottie).
* **Demo Showcase:** The screenshot or video should be high-resolution and visually appealing. If a video is used, keep it concise and focused on demonstrating the key features and user experience. Frame the video/screenshot within a clean, modern border or device mockup.
* **RAG Architecture Diagram:**
    * **Redesign of Current Diagram:**  Adapt the existing diagram to fit the modern and minimal aesthetic. Use clean lines, clear labels, and a consistent visual style.
    * **Gold Accents:**  Incorporate gold accents subtly within the diagram to highlight key elements or connections.
    * **Clarity and Simplicity:** Ensure the diagram is easy to understand at a glance, even for those without a deep technical background.

**E. Layout & Structure:**

* **Single-Page Layout:**  Maintain a clear visual hierarchy and logical flow as users scroll down the page.
* **Clear Sections:** Use visual dividers (e.g., subtle lines, changes in background color) and ample white space to separate sections and improve readability.
* **Hero Section Prominence:**  Make the hero section visually impactful and immediately communicate the core value proposition.
* **Consistent Spacing and Alignment:** Maintain consistent spacing between elements and ensure proper alignment for a polished look.
* **Mobile-First Design:**  The design must be fully responsive and adapt seamlessly to different screen sizes. Prioritize the mobile experience.

**F. Interactive Elements:**

* **Buttons:** Use the gold accent color for button backgrounds or borders (consider a white background with gold text and border). Ensure clear hover states (e.g., a subtle color change or animation).
* **Form Elements:** Design the contact form with a clean and user-friendly layout. Use clear labels and ensure error messages are easily visible.

**G. Figma Delivery:**

* Deliver the design as a well-organized Figma file with clear naming conventions for layers and components.
* Provide specifications for fonts, colors, and spacing.
* Include responsive variations for desktop, tablet, and mobile.
